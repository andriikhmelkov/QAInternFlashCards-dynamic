# QAInternFlashCards-dynamic

This repository contains updated, better and smarter copy of original project called [QAIternFlashCards](https://github.com/andriikhmelkov/QAInternFlashCards-original). "QAIternFlashCards" is flash cards web app I created during the second part of 2013 for my interview preparation for QA intern position. In this updated version content generated from the JSON file upon page load.

Inspired by "Create a CSS Flipping Animation // David Walsh" @ https://davidwalsh.name/ 

## Known issues and limitations
1. `ontouchstart="this.classList.toggle('hover');'>` is not generated properly by the script.
2. IE9 and older versions are not supported.
