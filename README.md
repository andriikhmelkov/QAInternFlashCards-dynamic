# QAInternFlashCards-dynamic

Flash cards web app I created in second part of 2013 for my interview preparation for QA intern position. This is better and smarter copy of original project called [QAIternFlashCards](https://github.com/andriikhmelkov/QAInternFlashCards-original). In this version contect generated dynamically from JSON file.

Inspired by "Create a CSS Flipping Animation // David Walsh" @ https://davidwalsh.name/ 

## Known issues
1. `ontouchstart="this.classList.toggle('hover');'>` is not generated proparly by script.
